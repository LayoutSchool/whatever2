Gestalt principles are related to how we understand what we are seeing. There is an in-built system that allows us to make sense of the world. 

These principles are: closure, common fate, figure-ground, good continuation, proximity, similarity, symmetry, and uniform connectedness.

<h3>Closure</h3>

<p>The principle of closure describes situations in which people, given only a part of the picture, will fill in the blanks.</p> 

<p>Another way to describe closure is that people tend to look at a complex grouping of visual elements and try to form a single image from it.</p>

<p>For example, look at this soccer ball:</p>

<p>The use of closure is often employed in logo design. An iconic example is the IBM logo. When we look at the logo, we only see letters:</p>

<p>Even though it's just a bunch of fragments, our mind fills in the blanks.</p>

<h3>Common Fate</h3>

<p>The principle of common fate is the mechanism by which we perceive things that are moving together to be related.</p>

<p>Here is an example of the common fate Gestalt principle in a logo. Notice how the round shapes in the logo visually share common fate.</p>

<h3>Figure-ground</h3>

<p>The principle of figure-ground is the way in which figures in the foreground are distinguishable from figures in the background.</p>

<p>A practical example is this McDonald's ad which turns pedestrian crossing stripes into french fries.</p>
