<p>CSS positioning is one of the basic skills that a frontend web developer needs to know.</p>

<p>The first thing to know is to have a general idea of how CSS positioning works. This includes knowing about the normal document flow in a web page: Left-to-right, top-to-bottom (of course, if your web page is in an RTL language, the flow will be right-to-left).</p>


<p>CSS layouts are made by manipulating this normal document flow.</p>

<p>We have three major CSS properties at our disposal, to manipulate normal document flow in a web page. These properties are: <strong>float</strong>, <strong>position</strong>, and <strong>display</strong>.</p>

<p>In this article, we'll look at the position property in detail.</p>

<h2 class="h2 mt-5">The available values for CSS position property</h2>
Position property in CSS can hold the following values:
<ul>
    <li>static</li>
    <li>relative</li>
    <li>absolute</li>
    <li>fixed</li>
    <li>sticky</li>
    <li>inherit</li>
    <li>initial</li>
    <li>unset</li>
</ul>

<p>We will start this article by looking at what all of these position properties do and how to apply them in practice.</p>

<h2 class="h2 mt-5 text-uppercase">POSITION: STATIC</h2>

<p>HTML elements start their life on a web page with the value of static on their position property. Static is just the normal positioning behavior of HTML elements.</p>

<p data-height="435" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="WXowYV" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="AjdinImsirovic" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="CSS positioning, static" data-preview="true" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic/pen/WXowYV/">CSS positioning, static</a> by Ajdin (<a href="https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic">@AjdinImsirovic</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>

<p>
Using static positioning, you cannot offset elements with top, right, bottom, and left properties. In order to be able to use these offset properties, you need a different kind of positioning.
</p>

<h2 class="h2 mt-5 text-uppercase">POSITION: RELATIVE</h2>

<p>Using the value of relative on the CSS position property, we now have at our displosal the four offset properties.</p>
<p>In the example that follows, we'll use the same code like we did in the previous example, with a slight twist: we'll change the positioning to relative, and we'll offset the wrapper by 100 pixels from the left side.</p>

<p>Note that we're also adding the offset property of left to box-2 and box-3.</p>

<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>


<h2 class="h2 mt-5 text-uppercase">POSITION: ABSOLUTE</h2>

<p>When you position an element absolutely, you take it out of the normal document flow.</p>

<p>Absolutely positioning an element is as if you've tacked that element onto a web page.</p>

<p>For example, we have set the wrapping .box to position: static, and then .box-1 to position: absolute. <p>That way, we've taken it out of the normal document flow, so that the other divs are painted on the viewport as if the absolutely positioned element did not even exist.</p>
<p>However, since it does exist, and since it is the last div element on the page, it covers all the other divs that are using display:static, i.e. that are part of the normal document flow.</p>
<p> This is what happens when you take an element out of the normal document flow.</p>

<p data-height="424" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="rYWMYP" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="AjdinImsirovic" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="CSS positioning, absolute" data-preview="true" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic/pen/rYWMYP/">CSS positioning, absolute</a> by Ajdin (<a href="https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic">@AjdinImsirovic</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>

<h2 class="h2 mt-5 text-uppercase">POSITION: FIXED</h2>

<p>Giving an element's position property the value of fixed is similar to pasting that element on the screen itself.</p>

<p>So, while absolute positioned elements are positioned in terms of the page they are on, they still move with the page. When elements are fixed, they will remain in their place even as the page scrolls.</p>

<p>What follows is an example of a fixed element (the green-colored box).</p>

<p>To the left of this fixed green-colored box, we have an absolutely positioned red box, which is taken out of the normal document flow and thus covers the statically positioned blue box.</p>

<p>Note however, that both the blue and the red boxes are moving <em>with the page</em>, while the green box remains fixed to the screen.</p>

<p data-height="373" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="Kyadzp" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="AjdinImsirovic" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="CSS positioning, fixed" data-preview="true" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic/pen/Kyadzp/">CSS positioning, fixed</a> by Ajdin (<a href="https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic">@AjdinImsirovic</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>

<h2 class="h2 mt-5 text-uppercase">POSITION: STICKY</h2>

<p>Position sticky is a combination of relative and fixed positioning principles. Basically, an element with position: sticky, behaves just like a relatively positioned element, until it reaches a certain part of the web page, at which time it behaves as if it's position was set as <em>property:fixed</em>.</p>

<h2 class="h2 mt-5 text-uppercase">POSITION: INHERIT</h2>
<p>
    If you want an element to inherit it's parent's position property's value, you use position: inherit. What's interesting about the position property is that it does not cascade, so using position: inherit changes that default behavior.
</p>

<h2 class="h2 mt-5 text-uppercase">POSITION: INITIAL</h2>
<p>
    As a value, initial is used for any property in CSS. In other words, it is not only tied to the position property.
</p>
<p>
    Basically, using the value of initial with any CSS property simply means that you want the browser to revert back to the default setting for that property.
</p>
<p>
    Giving an element a value of position: initial is the same as if we gave it position: static, as position: static is the default value for all HTML elements.
</p>

<h2 class="h2 mt-5 text-uppercase">POSITION: UNSET</h2>
<p>
    Unset is sort of a hybrid value, in the sense that it is a combination of behaviors of the initial and inherit properties.
</p>
<p>
    You can think of it as a sort of an if-statement, as the result of using it will be different based on the context it is used in.
</p>
<ul>
    The way that it works is as follows:
    <li>If an element inherits the property from a parent element, using unset CSS value will revert the property to the inherited value.</li>
    <li>If an element does not inherit the property from its parent element, using unset CSS value will revert the property to the initial value.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the specific case of position property, we need to remember that the position property does not cascade, and thus, looking at the above 2 if statements, the second if statement applies. Simply put, using position: unset will be the same as if we used position: static.</p>
