<p>CSS positioning is one of the basic skills that a frontend web developer needs to know.</p>

<p>The first thing to know is to have a general idea of how CSS positioning works. This includes knowing about the normal document flow in a web page: Left-to-right, top-to-bottom (of course, if your web page is in an RTL language, the flow will be right-to-left).</p>


<p>Most layouts are made by manipulating this normal document flow. To that end, we have multiple values for the position property in CSS. We'll look at all of them in detail in this article.</p>

<h2>POSITION: STATIC</h2>

<p>HTML elements start their life on a web page with the value of static on their position property. Static is just the normal positioning behavior of HTML elements.</p>

<p data-height="435" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="WXowYV" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="AjdinImsirovic" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="CSS positioning, static" data-preview="true" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic/pen/WXowYV/">CSS positioning, static</a> by Ajdin (<a href="https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic">@AjdinImsirovic</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>

<p>
Using static positioning, you cannot offset elements with top, right, bottom, and left properties. In order to be able to use these offset properties, you need a different kind of positioning.
</p>

<h2>POSITION: RELATIVE</h2>

<p>Using the value of relative on the CSS position property, we now have at our displosal the four offset properties.</p>
<p>In the example that follows, we'll use the same code like we did in the previous example, with a slight twist: we'll change the positioning to relative, and we'll offset the wrapper by 100 pixels from the left side.</p>

<p>Note that we're also adding the offset property of left to box-2 and box-3.</p>

<p data-height="428" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="vWyXxL" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="AjdinImsirovic" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="CSS positioning, relative" data-preview="true" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic/pen/vWyXxL/">CSS positioning, relative</a> by Ajdin (<a href="https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic">@AjdinImsirovic</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>


<h2>POSITION: ABSOLUTE</h2>

<p>When you position an element absolutely, you take it out of the normal document flow.</p>

<p>Absolutely positioning an element is as if you've tacked that element onto a web page.</p>

<p>For example, we have set the wrapping .box to position: static, and then .box-1 to position: absolute. <p>That way, we've taken it out of the normal document flow, so that the other divs are painted on the viewport as if the absolutely positioned element did not even exist.</p><p> This is what happens when you take an element out of the normal document flow.</p>

<p data-height="424" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="rYWMYP" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="AjdinImsirovic" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="CSS positioning, absolute" data-preview="true" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic/pen/rYWMYP/">CSS positioning, absolute</a> by Ajdin (<a href="https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic">@AjdinImsirovic</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

<h2>POSITION: FIXED</h2>

<p>Giving an elements position property the value of fixed is similar to pasting that element on the screen itself.</p>

<p>So, while absolute positioned elements are positioned in terms of the page they are on, they still move with the page. When elements are fixed, they will remain in their place even as the page scrolls.</p>

<p>What follows is an example of a fixed element (the green-colored box).</p>

<p>To the left of this fixed green-colored box, we have an absolutely positioned red box, which is taken out of the normal document flow and thus covers the statically positioned blue box.</p>

<p>Note however, that both the blue and the red boxes are moving <em>with the page</em>, while the green box remains fixed to the screen.</p>
