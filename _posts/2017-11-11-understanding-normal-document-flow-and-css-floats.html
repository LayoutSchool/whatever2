<p>
Before making HTML layouts, you need to understand the normal document flow of HTML pages, and know how to use the following CSS properties: <strong>float</strong>, <strong>position</strong>, and <strong>display</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    In this article, we'll look at just what this normal document flow is, and how the CSS properties of <strong>display</strong> and <strong>float</strong>work with it.
</p>

    Normal document flow
</h2>

<p>
We can think of the normal document flow as a river of content (i.e. HTML elements). All the content on our page flows down this "river", left-to-right, then top-to-bottom.
</p>

<img class="img-fluid" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/2017/11/11/normal-document-flow.png" alt="Normal document flow in a web page">

<p>
    The caveat here is that some content will take up the full width of the screen, i.e. the full "left-to-right" portion of the "river". 
</p>

<p>
    The div element is an example of such behavior. Regardless of how wide the div's content actually is, it will always take up the full width of the available screen. 
</p>

<p>
    Let's imagine that we have 2 divs in our web page, with their display property unchanged.
</p>
<p>
    Let's give those 2 divs the width of 100 pixels each, and let's give them the background color of pink. Finally, we'll add just a bit of dummy text to each of these divs.
</p>

<p>
    Here's the result:
</p>

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="KymgGm" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="AjdinImsirovic" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Normal document flow and block-level elements" data-preview="true" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic/pen/KymgGm/">Normal document flow and block-level elements</a> by Ajdin (<a href="https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic">@AjdinImsirovic</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>

<p>
    Note that even though That's why the div element is referred to as a block-level element. When we say that an HTML element is a block-level element, we are referring to it's display property.
</p>

<p>
    In other words, some elements, referred to as block-level elements, will take up the full width of the available screen space, not allowing any other element to fit on either their left side, or their right side.
