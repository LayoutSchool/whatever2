<p>
Before making HTML layouts, you need to understand the normal document flow of HTML pages, and know how to use the following CSS properties: <strong>float</strong>, <strong>position</strong>, and <strong>display</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    In this article, we'll look at just what this normal document flow is, and how the CSS properties of <strong>display</strong> and <strong>float</strong> work with it.
</p>

    Normal document flow
</h2>

<p>
We can think of the normal document flow as a river of content (i.e. HTML elements). All the content on our page flows down this "river", left-to-right, then top-to-bottom.
</p>

<img class="img-fluid" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/2017/11/11/normal-document-flow.png" alt="Normal document flow in a web page">

<p>
    The caveat here is that some content will take up the full width of the screen, i.e. the full "left-to-right" portion of the "river". 
</p>

<p>
    The div element is an example of such behavior. Regardless of how wide the div's content actually is, it will always take up the full width of the screen. 
</p>

    Demo: Default Behavior of Block-level HTML Elements
</h3>
<p>
    Let's imagine that we have 2 divs in our web page, with their display property unchanged.
</p>
<p>
    Let's give those 2 divs the width of 100 pixels each, and let's give them the background color of pink. Finally, we'll add just a bit of dummy text to each of these divs.
</p>

<p>
    Here's the result:
</p>

<p data-height="328" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="KymgGm" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="AjdinImsirovic" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Normal document flow and block-level elements" data-preview="true" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic/pen/KymgGm/">Normal document flow and block-level elements</a> by Ajdin (<a href="https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic">@AjdinImsirovic</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

<p>
    That's why the div element is referred to as a block-level element. When we say that an HTML element is a block-level element, we are referring to it's display property.
</p>

<p>
    In other words, some elements, referred to as block-level elements, will take up the full width of the available screen space, not allowing any other element to fit on either their left side, or their right side.
</p>

<p>
    This leads us to an obvious question: Given the default behavior of block-level elements, including divs, how do we then fit two divs next to each other? 
</p>

<h3 class="h3 mt-5">
    Ways to place two divs side-by-side
</h3>
<p>
    There are many ways to achieve this. However, since this article is dealing with the display, float, and normal document flow, we will focus on these.
</p>
<p>
    Specifically, we will look at two different ways of making 2 divs fit side-by-side, rather than stack on top of one another. These two ways are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Changing the value of the display property</li>
    <li>Using floats</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="h4 mt-5">
    Changing the value of the display property to position two divs next to each other
</h4>
<p>
    Before we dive into this solution, it is important to note that there are many possible values that we can give our CSS display property. While divs and some other elements have the display: block; CSS declaration set by default, some other HTML elements have display: inline; set as their default.
</p>
<p>
    Thus, by virtue of changing the display value to something other than "block", we can get our desired effect, as can be seen in the next example:
</p>

<p data-height="277" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="VrbmLZ" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="AjdinImsirovic" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Using display: inline on divs" data-preview="true" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic/pen/VrbmLZ/">Using display: inline on divs</a> by Ajdin (<a href="https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic">@AjdinImsirovic</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

<p>
    In the example above, we have four divs. On the first two divs, we changed the display property to "inline", which places our divs next to one another.
</p>
<p> 
    The above example also brings us to the interesting behavior of margins on elements that have display property set to inline.
</p>

<h4 class="h4 mt-5">
    What happens with margins on DIVs that have display: inline?
</h4>
<p>
    Besides not spanning the full width of the screen, there are also other differences between block level elements and inline elements. What follows is a list of things that are specific to inline elements:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Setting the width and height property on inline elements will not change anything.</li>
    <li>Setting the padding and/or margin property on inline elements will only affect the horizontal axis.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's see an example of setting these properties on inline elements:</p>

<p data-height="293" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="RjVKWL" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="AjdinImsirovic" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Using display: inline on divs AND height, width, padding, and margin" data-preview="true" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic/pen/RjVKWL/">Using display: inline on divs AND height, width, padding, and margin</a> by Ajdin (<a href="https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic">@AjdinImsirovic</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

<p>
    As we can see above, the width and height are not honored. The margins are honored only for the horizontal axis, and the padding sort of works in all directions.
</p>

<p>
    However, since the box model is essentially broken (or at least, significantly warped), it is best to assign padding, margin, and dimensions only to inline blocks' wrapping elements.
</p>
