Before making HTML layouts, you need to understand the normal document flow of HTML pages, and know how to use the following CSS properties: <strong>float</strong>, <strong>position</strong>, and <strong>display</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    In this article, we'll look at just what this normal document flow is, and how the CSS properties of <strong>display</strong> and <strong>float</strong>work with it.

    Normal document flow

<p>
We can think of the normal document flow as a river of content (i.e. HTML elements). All the content on our page flows down this "river", left-to-right, then top-to-bottom.
</p>

<img class="img-fluid" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/2017/11/11/normal-document-flow-in-a-web-page.png" alt="Normal document flow in a web page">

<p>
    The caveat here is that some content will take up the full width of the screen, i.e. the full "left-to-right" portion of the "river". 
</p>

<p>
    The div element is an example of such behavior. Regardless of how wide the div's content actually is, it will always take up the full width of the available screen. 
</p>

<p>
    That's why the div element is referred as a block element. When we say that an HTML element is a block element, we are referring to it's display property.
</p>

<p>
    In other words, some elements, referred to as block elements, will take up the full width of the available screen space, not allowing any other element to fit on either their left side, or their right side.
