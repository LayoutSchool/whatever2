<p>
A pre-requisite to being able to make CSS layouts is to understand the normal document flow of HTML pages. Also, to work effectively with layouts, a front-end web developer needs to understand the following CSS properties: floats, position, and display.

    In this article, we'll look at just what this normal document flow is, and how the CSS property of float works with it.

<p>
We can think of the normal document flow as the law of physics, specifically, the law of gravity. All elements on all webpages obey this rule.

<p>
    This "law of gravity" says: When a web page is rendered by a browser, all the content in that web page will go left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
