<p>
Before making HTML layouts, you need to understand the normal document flow of HTML pages, and know how to use the following CSS properties: <strong>float</strong>, <strong>position</strong>, and <strong>display</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    In this article, we'll look at just what this normal document flow is, and how the CSS properties of <strong>display</strong> and <strong>float</strong> work with it.
</p>

<h2 class="h2 mt-5">
    Normal document flow
</h2>

<p>
We can think of the normal document flow as a river of content (i.e. a "river" of HTML elements). All the content on our page flows down this "river", left-to-right, then top-to-bottom.
</p>

<p>
    It is this default "flow" that determines how an HTML element will be displayed on a page.
</p>

<img class="img-fluid" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/2017/11/11/normal-document-flow.png" alt="Normal document flow in a web page">

<p>
    The caveat here is that some content will take up the full width of the screen, i.e. the full "left-to-right" portion of the "river". 
</p>

<p>
    Many HTML elements behave this way, and the div element is one of them. These elements are referred to as block level elements. Regardless of how wide a block element's content actually is, it will always take up the full width of the screen, and whatever follows it, will stack under it.
</p>

<p>
    Another way to think of it is that block level elements have an implicit line break at their edge.
</p>

<h3 class="h3 mt-5">
    Demo: Default Behavior of Block-level HTML Elements
</h3>
<p>
    Let's imagine that we have 2 divs in our web page, with their display property unchanged.
</p>
<p>
    Let's give those 2 divs the width of 100 pixels each, and let's give them the background color of pink. Finally, we'll add just a bit of dummy text to each of these divs.
</p>

<p>
    Here's the result:
</p>

<p data-height="328" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="KymgGm" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="AjdinImsirovic" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Normal document flow and block-level elements" data-preview="true" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic/pen/KymgGm/">Normal document flow and block-level elements</a> by Ajdin (<a href="https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic">@AjdinImsirovic</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

<p>
    That's why the div element is referred to as a block-level element. When we say that an HTML element is a block-level element, we are referring to it's display property.
</p>

<p>
    In other words, some elements, referred to as block-level elements, will take up the full width of the available screen space, not allowing any other element to fit on either their left side, or their right side.
</p>

<p>
    This leads us to an obvious question: Given the default behavior of block-level elements, including divs, how do we then fit two divs next to each other? 
</p>

<h3 class="h3 mt-5">
    Ways to place two divs side-by-side
</h3>
<p>
    There are many ways to achieve this. However, since this article is dealing with the display, float, and normal document flow, we will focus on these.
</p>
<p>
    Specifically, we will look at two different ways of making 2 divs fit side-by-side, rather than stack on top of one another. These two ways are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Changing the value of the display property</li>
    <li>Using floats</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="h4 mt-5">
    Changing the value of the display property to position two divs next to each other
</h4>
<p>
    Before we dive into this solution, it is important to note that there are many possible values that we can give our CSS display property. While divs and some other elements have the <code>display: block</code> set by default, some other HTML elements have <code>display: inline</code> set as their default.
</p>
<p>
    Thus, by virtue of changing the display value to something other than "block", we can get our desired effect, as can be seen in the next example:
</p>

<p data-height="277" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="VrbmLZ" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="AjdinImsirovic" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Using display: inline on divs" data-preview="true" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic/pen/VrbmLZ/">Using display: inline on divs</a> by Ajdin (<a href="https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic">@AjdinImsirovic</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

<p>
    In the example above, we have four divs. On the first two divs, we assigned <code>display:inline</code>, which places our divs next to one another.
</p>
<p> 
    The above example also shows us the interesting behavior of margins, paddings, and dimensions, on elements that have display property set to inline.
</p>

<h4 class="h4 mt-5">
    What happens with margins on DIVs that have display: inline?
</h4>
<p>
    Besides not spanning the full width of the screen, there are also other differences between block level elements and inline elements. What follows is a list of things that are specific to inline elements:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Setting the width and height property on inline elements will not change anything.</li>
    <li>Setting the margin property on inline elements will only affect the horizontal axis.</li>
    <li>Setting the padding property on inline elements will affect both the x and the y axis, but will not work as expected because <code>display: inline</code> warps the box model.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's see an example of setting these properties on inline elements:</p>

<p data-height="293" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="RjVKWL" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="AjdinImsirovic" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Using display: inline on divs AND height, width, padding, and margin" data-preview="true" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic/pen/RjVKWL/">Using display: inline on divs AND height, width, padding, and margin</a> by Ajdin (<a href="https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic">@AjdinImsirovic</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

<p>
    As we can see above, the width and height are not honored. The margins are honored only for the horizontal axis, and the padding sort of works in all directions.
</p>

<p>
    However, since the box model on inline elements is essentially broken (or at least, significantly warped), it is best to assign padding, margin, and dimensions only to inline blocks' wrapping elements, and thus avoid these issues.
</p>

<h4 class="h4 mt-5">
    Introducing the inline-block value for the display property
</h4>
<p>
    So far, we've seen the <code>display: block</code> and the <code>display: inline</code> property. However, there are quite a few more.
</p>
<p>
    To become familiar with what is available, let's list all the possible values of the display property: 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>box, inline-box, block, contents, flex, flow-root, grid, inherit, initial, inline, inline-block, inline-flex, inline-grid, inline-table, list-item, none, table, table-caption, table-cell, table-column, table-column-group, table-footer-group, table-header-group, table-row, table-row-group, unset</li>
</ul>
<p>
    In the above list, there are 26 possible values for the display property.
</p>

<p>
    At this point, we will focus on <code>inline-block</code>.
</p>
<p>
    The benefit of using <code>inline-block</code> is simple: it supports using the box model. However, it also has downsides, namely in obeying whitespace.
</p>
<p>
    Put differently, using <code>inline-block</code> on divs allows you to use a div as an inline element that <em>honors</em> the box model, but that element will <em>also</em> honor whitespace.
</p>
<p>
    Here is what we get in practice:
</p>

<p data-height="346" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="jammvp" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="AjdinImsirovic" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Using display: inline-block on divs adds box model AND whitespace" data-preview="true" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic/pen/jammvp/">Using display: inline-block on divs adds box model AND whitespace</a> by Ajdin (<a href="https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic">@AjdinImsirovic</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

<p>
    Let's discuss the example above. First, you can see that we have two sets of divs there. These two sets of divs are identical, as in, the second div is a copy-paste of the first div.
</p>
<p>
    However, looking at the screen output of the HTML code to the left, we can see that there is a small portion of whitespace between the first and the second div. 
</p>
<p>
    Contrast that to the second set of divs, where the divs are not touching, even though the code is 99% identical. What's the only difference between the two sets of divs?
</p>
<p>
    The actual markup on the second set of divs does not include any whitespace between the individual divs.
</p>
<p>
    We have just explained both the problem with <code>display:inline-block</code>, and the solution to this problem.
</p>
<p>
    Thus, if you ever find yourself scretching your head as to why an element that has <code>display:inline-block</code> is behaving strange, it is probably the case of <strong>whitespace between elements</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    There is an alternative solution to this as well, and it might prove worth using depending on the specific layout you're working on.
</p>
<p>
    The alternative solution involves declaring <code>font-size: 0</code> on the parent element.
</p>
<p>
    Here is an example for this approach. Similar to the previous example, we use two <strong>identical</strong> sets of divs. The only difference is that the second set's wrapper has an additional CSS class of <code>fs0</code>.
</p>

<p>
    The result is just what we need: the inline-block elements are not honoring whitespace, which is the behavior that we'd expect in the first place.    
</p>
<h4 class="h4 mt-5">
    Making sense of 26 possible display property values
</h4>
<p>
    At this point, we have looked at <code>display: block</code>, <code>display: inline</code>, and <code>display: inline-block</code>.
</p>
<p>
    How do we make sense of so many other possible values? It's simple, we'll divide and conquer!
</p>
<p>
    Instead of looking at the long list of values, we will group them in the following way:
</p>

  </tr>
</table>
<!-- end table -->






<p>
    Looking at the table above, it is much easier to reason about the display property now.
</p>

<p>
    Basically, what we have done is, we have divided all the values into logical, meaningful sub-groups:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Block</strong>: includes the "regular" block, inline-block, and inline values</li>
    <li><strong>Flex and Grid</strong>: inludes the more recent CSS layout specifications</li>
    <li><strong>Table</strong>: all the values we can use to make our elements display as if they were HTML tables</li>
    <li><strong>"Exotic"</strong>: used less frequently, most people don't know about these, or they are simply deprecated (like <code>box</code>)</li>
    <li><strong>CSS-wide</strong>: values that are used on almost all CSS properties (not just display)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    For the rest of this article, we will focus our attention on <code>float</code> property, and they way it works with the <strong>"block group"</strong> of values for the display property.
</p>

<h3 class="h3 mt-5">
    CSS float property vs CSS display property
</h3>
<p>
    It's time to discuss one of the most important concepts in CSS: the <code>float</code> property. 
</p>

<p>
    You can set the float property to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>left</li></code>
    <li><code>right</li></code>
    <li><code>none</li></code>
    <li><code>inherit</li></code>
    <li><code>initial</li></code>
    <li><code>unset</li></code>
</ul>

<p>
    Setting the float to right or left, will force the display to take the value of block, with a few specific consequences:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>the floated element will become displayed as as block, but will not take up the full width of the screen</li>
    <li>the element that comes after the floated element will start at the top and will need to be cleared.</li>
    <li>the floated element's parent will not be "aware" of the floated element's height</li>
</ul>

<p>
    That's a lot of concepts, so let's look at an example: 
</p>

<p data-height="409" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="MOmzPY" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="AjdinImsirovic" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Behavior of float:left or float:right" data-preview="true" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic/pen/MOmzPY/">Behavior of float:left or float:right</a> by Ajdin (<a href="https://codepen.io/AjdinImsirovic">@AjdinImsirovic</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

<p>
    Looking at the example above, we can draw a number of conclusions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The parent div's background is gray. The fact that the green-colored floated div is taller than it's parent is the proof that the parent div is not "aware" of the floated div's height</li>
    <li>The second group of divs, which is 99% identical to the first group, is awkwardly positioned to the right of the first floated div, under the first group of pink divs. This is an example of why those div's need to be cleared.</li>
    <li>The second group of divs honors whitespace, while the first group doesn't. Can you guess what's the pink divs' display property? Of course, it's inline-block. We are using a hack to fix this in the second group of divs. The hack is simple, we are using empty HTML comments. <small>Note: While the merit of empty HTML comments' hack can be debated, we've listed it here to further explain approaches that you'll be seeing online to the issue of <code>inline-block</code> not honoring whitespace.</small></li>
</ul>
<p>
    The most important point of the above example is that the parent div is not aware of the height of it's child, and that we need to clear floats.
</p>

<h3 class="h3 mt-5">
    Making the parent div aware of the height of the child div that has the float property

    Consider the following example:
